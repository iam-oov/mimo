# 🎉 Multi-Agent System - Successfully Integrated!

## ✅ Problem Resolution

**Issue:** Frontend error `404 Not Found` when calling `/api/multi-agent-analysis/stream`

**Root Cause:** The multi-agent endpoints were not present in `server.py`

**Solution:** Added both API endpoints to `server.py` with proper:

- Tax calculation integration
- Authentication checks
- Rate limiting
- Streaming support

## 📝 Changes Made to `server.py`

### 1. **Imports Added** (Line 19-20)

```python
from tabla_isr_constants import TablaISR, get_tabla_isr
from multi_agent_analysis import MultiAgentAnalysisService
```

### 2. **POST `/api/multi-agent-analysis`** (Lines 852-895)

- Non-streaming endpoint for complete analysis
- Returns full debate result with experts, conversation, votes, winner, and conclusion
- Checks daily recommendation limits
- Calculates taxes before running analysis
- Increments usage counter after successful generation

### 3. **POST `/api/multi-agent-analysis/stream`** (Lines 898-947)

- Streaming endpoint with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Real-time updates for UI as debate progresses
- Same authentication and rate limiting as non-streaming
- Yields events: initialization, phase, chunk, intervention_complete, voting_results, complete, error

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Tax Calculation Flow

```python
1. Get ISR table: get_tabla_isr(fiscal_year)
2. Create TaxCalculator instance
3. Call calculate_tax_balance() → returns TaxCalculationResult
4. Pass result to MultiAgentAnalysisService.run_analysis_stream()
```

### Service Method Call

```python
MultiAgentAnalysisService.run_analysis_stream(
    calculation_result,      # TaxCalculationResult object
    user_data_for_calculation,  # Dict with all tax data
    tax_data.fiscal_year     # Int (2024 or 2025)
)
```
